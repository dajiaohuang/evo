Shows considerable variability in growth form, leaf size and shape; narrow-leaved, weakish plants and atypical, ± glabrescent forms should not be confused with G. capense subsp. garipense. In the eastern Cape the two taxa are occasionally difficult to distinguish.

## morphology / claims / text

<!-- evo:text /records/catalogue-dossier/facets/morphology/claims/2/text -->
G. scabrelloides shows close affinity to the ± tropical East African G. scabrellum but differs in having stems with much longer internodes, longer, often broader leaves, frequently very broadly pyramidal synflorescences with bracts at the ultimate branches, longer peduncles and often larger flowers with acute, but not acuminate corolla lobes. Although the two species are sometimes difficult to distinguish morphologically, species status, in my opinion, appears most appropriate for this southern “vicariant” of G. scabrellum, particularly in view of the generally narrow species concepts adopted here. G. scabrelloides displays considerable variability in its growth form (branching pattern) and leaf size and shape, which, to a certain extent, seems to be environment-dependent. Very narrow-leaved, weakish forms were often mistaken for “G. wittbergense” ( = G. capense ssp. garipense var. wittbergense). They are, however, easily distinguished from the latter by the indumentum (particularly of the gynoceum: straight hairs in G. scabrelloides; short, curled hairs in the G. capense complex) and the leaf margins with very closely set reversed prickles. G. scabrelloides and G. capense ssp. garipense are frequently found growing in the same area, but usually a clear difference in ecological demands is recognizable: G. scabrelloides prefers more sheltered, not open habitats and is frequently found in between much higher growing vegetation. It appears to favour somewhat wetter habitats. It was also observed that G. scabrelloides begins flowering much later than G. capense ssp. garipense when the two taxa were seen in the same area. I have seen no hybrids, but in my opinion it cannot be excluded that introgression takes place between the two taxa. Occasionally one encounters ± glabrescent forms (subglabrous gynoeceum; leaf surfaces with very few hairs only). Since such forms may even occur within populations whose individuals have a perfectly normal indumentum, they of course deserve no taxonomic recognition.
