Plants of Q. mammillaris form robust, densely branched shrubs and may be up to 600 mm tall and broad. Generally Q. mammillaris is easily recognised by its usually uniformly coloured, erect stems, which branch mostly from their base and root from the central stem only. It is noteworthy that in this species, unlike several others that also only root centrally, cuttings are very difficult to root. The tubercles on the stems are irregularly arranged and rarely form the four neat rows found in most of the other species. They are also very sharply armed with a hard, yellow-brown spike and these make the plants thorny and difficult to handle. The flowers, which reach 27 mm across, are among the largest in the genus. They are produced in large numbers in many dense, more or less simultaneously opening clusters and emit a strong, foul smell so that a plant in flower can often be detected from some distance away before it is seen. The lobes taper progressively from the base to a fine point and are strongly folded along the middle, which makes them quite slender. Usually they do not spread out much but this is mainly because of overcrowding in the inflorescences. On the inside they are dark purple-black and this dark colour continues just into the mouth of the tube, where it breaks up to form spots and rings on a white background in the tube. This tube is comparatively deep and it is slightly constricted at the mouth by thickening there of the corolla. Most of the inside of the flower is covered with papillae tipped with bristles which reach their greatest length in the mouth of the tube but disappear lower down. The dark corona consists of a cupular outer series and inner lobes which, after covering the anthers, rise in a small column in the centre. They have an erect dorsal projection more or less in series with the lobules of the outer corona. Although vegetatively and florally relatively uniform over most of its range, there are two ecological races which differ in some respects. One of these is what Dinter baptised Sarcophagophilus winklerianus. In Namibia this is known in the Klinghardt Mountains and in the Schakalsberge as well as further east between Lorelei and the mouth of the Fish River. It is also known further south near Annisfontein in the western Richtersveld of South Africa. Plants usually grow on rocky, schist or dolomitic slopes among many other succulent shrubs. The broader stems with more scattered, larger and very triangular tubercles lend it a generally heavier appearance than the typical form but florally it cannot be distinguished from typical Q. mammillaris. In the other race the stems are narrower (usually only 15 -20 mm thick), they are conspicuously mottled with purple-brown on paler green and often have quite thin, long teeth on the tubercles. Plants may occasionally root on side-branches, a phenomenon otherwise never seen in Q. mammillaris, and, perhaps as a consequence, they may form quite low, spreading and very dense clusters. The flowers are, however, the same as those of typical Q. mammillaris. This is an ecotype which is restricted to soils derived from sandstones. It is found around Citrusdal, in a few scattered, dry localities in the Cedarberg and Swartruggens south-eastwards to near Karoopoort and also in a few spots in sandstones east and south-east of Touws River. Plants usually grow in semi-arid, transitional fynbos among scattered specimens of the succulent Aizoaceae, Pelargonium alternans and various species of Crassula, often with clumps of Protea and Restionaceae in evidence. They often occur on horizontal or gently sloping sandstone slabs where the soils are especially shallow.
