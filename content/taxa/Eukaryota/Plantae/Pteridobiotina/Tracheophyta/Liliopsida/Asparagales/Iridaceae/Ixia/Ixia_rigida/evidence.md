<!-- evo:text /records/catalogue-dossier/facets/morphology/claims/0/text -->
Plants (150-)300-600 mm high, stem usually with 2-3 ± erect branches held close to axis, sheathed at base by firm, chestnut brown cataphylls, combining with old corm tunics and leaf bases to form collar around base. Corm 12-18 mm diam., tunics of firm, relatively hard fibres. Leaves (3-)5-7, lower (2-)3-6 with expanded blades, upper 1 or 2 leaves sheathing lower 1/3 to middle of stem, blades sword-shaped to sub-linear, (3-)5-8 mm wide, main vein, margins, and often secondary vein pairs moderately thickened, hyaline when dry. Spike weakly flexuose, nodding in bud, mostly 8-15-flowered, lateral spikes with fewer flowers; bracts membranous, silver-translucent, ± 5.5-7.0 mm long, outer with prominent brown or purple central vein and few secondary veins not reaching upper margin, acute or with 2 obscure lateral lobes, inner 2-veined and acutely 2-toothed. Flowers rotate, pale pink, darker at tepal bases and ± white in throat, sweetly rose-scented; perianth tube funnel-shaped, ± 2.5 mm long, filiform and clasping style in basal 1.5 mm or less, widely flared distally for up to 1 mm; tepals spreading, ovate-oblong, ± 12(-15) x 5(-7) mm, obtuse. Stamens symmetrically arranged, erect; filaments inserted at mouth of narrow part of tube, filiform, ± 1.5(2.5) mm long, ± white; anthers oblong to linear, curved back at base, 3-4(5) mm long, slightly recurved basally, thecae subacute at base, dehiscing fully by longitudinal slits, yellow. Style dividing at base of filaments, branches ± straight, 2.0-3.0(3.5) mm long, ± filiform-tubular, stigmatic apically, white.

## morphology / claims / text

<!-- evo:text /records/catalogue-dossier/facets/morphology/claims/1/text -->
Ixia rigida is a distinctive species easily recognized by the moderately tall stem up to 600 mm high with 2-3 upright branches held close to the axis, and the silvery, translucent floral bracts subtending very short-tubed flowers, the tube up to 2.5 mm long with the narrow portion up to ± 1.5 mm long. Plants have up to seven leathery leaves with prominently thickened margins and main and secondary veins. Although fairly uniform across its range the populations of Ixia rigida inland of the Roggeveld escarpment and flowering three to four weeks earlier than those along the edge of the escarpment, thus in September, have slightly larger flowers and less fibrotic leaves. Too little is known about I. rigida to assess the significance of this variation. The escarpment populations mostly have 6 or 7 leaves, typically 5-7 mm wide, tepals ± 12 x 5 mm, anthers ± 3 mm long, and style branches ± 2 mm long. The inland populations have 4 or 5 leaves, mostly 7-8 mm wide, tepals ± 14-16 x 6-8 mm, slightly longer filaments, anthers 4(5) mm long, and style branches ± 3.5 mm long. The bracts of the inland plants also stand out in their darker purple veins. There appears to be no imminent threat to its survival but at some sites plants were heavily overgrazed and often do not set seed as a result. Tentative suggestion of a conservation status of near-threatened, (NT).

Plants have up to seven leathery leaves with prominently thickened margins, main and secondary veins. Ixia rigida was until 2012 associated with I. brevifolia, but this is now understood to be a separate species. Although fairly uniform across its range populations inland and flowering three to four weeks earlier than those along the edge of the escarpment, thus in September, have slightly larger flowers and less fibrous leaves. The escarpment populations mostly have 6 or 7 leaves, typically 5-7 mm wide, tepals ± 12 x 5 mm, anthers ± 3 mm long, and style branches ± 2 mm long. The inland populations have 4 or 5 leaves, mostly 7-8 mm wide, tepals ± 14-16 x 6-8 mm, slightly longer filaments, anthers 4(5) mm long, and style branches ± 3.5 mm long.
